POLYRHYTHM PENGUIN v0.1

A game about penguins, music, cloning, global warming, Christmas, and scooping 
up after your wooly mammoth.

Live demo at http://chchch.github.io/polypenguin/

If your keyboard doesn't support pressing 8 keys simultaneously, try this 
version: http://chchch.github.io/polypenguin/?as_in=beer

Tested in Chrome and Firefox, probably works in Safari.
